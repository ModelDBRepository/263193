</p>
<p>This archive was contributed by B Barlow. It requires the NEURON simulator and
works under mac, linux, and mswin.
</p>
<p>To run the model, extract this archive and then depending on your platform:
</p>
<p>mac, linux/unix:<br/>
  ----------------
</p>

type at the terminal prompt

<p>python3 example_Fig2a.py
</p>
mswin<br/>
-----
<p>Using the spyder app in the IPython console type<p/>
import example_Fig2a
</p>
<p>The figures will appear in a Plots pane.
</p>
<hr/>
The following figures will be generated (you can close one to see the next) which correspond to Figure 2a in the paper in the order of the middle, top, and then bottom traces:
